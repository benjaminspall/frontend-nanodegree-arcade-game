#Front-End Nanodegree Arcade Game

This Front-End Nanodegree Arcade Game is a take on the classic _Frogger_ arcade game. You can run the game right here in your browser.

## How to Play

To play the game, use your up, down, left, and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move your hero out from the safe grassy area into the enemy bugs' line of fire!

Don't dawdle as you cross the enemy bugs' territory. Their speed can change in an instant and catch you unawares before you make it to the safety of the water on the other side.

## In Development

The player's score, though currently being calculated, will be displayed in an updated version. This version will also include objects to collect, and new items to avoid.

## Art Assets and Starter Code

The art assets and starter code for this project were provided as part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree Arcade Game repo, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).
